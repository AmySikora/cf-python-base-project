# Exercise 1.2
## Task Create a Structure Named recipe_1
- **name (str):** Contains the recipe name
- **cooking_time (int):** Contains cook time in minutes 
- **ingredients (list):** Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

I will use dictionaries to store the above items, because they are able to store values, objects, srings, integers, lists, and other data. The can also be indexed by ideitifers and key, whch would make finding recipes and ingredients easier to access and update. 

I think that the flexibilty that dictionaries provide make them the best choice for this task.


**all_recipes = [ ]**

For the outer structure, I will use lists to store the recipe dictionaries. They are simple to use and are updateable.

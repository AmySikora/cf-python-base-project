# cf-python-base Project

This is the repository where I will be storing my tasks and achievements as I am learning Python.

I will be adding folders for each step of the project that I am work on.

## Description
A simple script (`add.py`) that calculates the sum of two numbers entered by the user.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Activate the virtual environment.
4. Run the script:
   ```zsh
   python add.py
# cf-python-base Project

Welcome to my cf-python-base repository! This is where I’ll be documenting my progress and tasks as I learn Python. Each step of the project will be organized into folders to keep everything structured and easy to follow.

## Description
This project includes a simple Python script (`add.py`) that prompts the user to input two numbers and then calculates and displays their sum. It’s a fundamental but essential step in practicing Python.

## How to Run
To run the script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd cf-python-base-project
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   Ensure you have the virtual environment `cf-python-base` activated. If you haven’t already, create and activate it:
   ```bash
   workon cf-python-base
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   If this is your first time running the project, install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to calculate the sum of two numbers:
   ```bash
   python add.py
   ```

6. **Follow the Prompts**:
   Enter two numbers when prompted, and the script will display their sum.

- **6_Added to GitHub w: folder.png**: Shows that the project is setup in GitHub and has a Task 1.1 folder

## Next Steps
I will continue adding more tasks to this repository as I progress through the course. Each step will be documented in its own folder.

Stay tuned for updates!

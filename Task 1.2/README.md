# Exercise 1.2
## Task Create a Structure Named recipe_1
- **name (str):** Contains the recipe name
- **cooking_time (int):** Contains cook time in minutes 
- **ingredients (list):** Contains a number of ingredients, each of the str data type

I will use a dictionaries to store the the above data, beacuse they are able to store srings, integers, and lists. They can also sclar and can be updated. 

**all_recipes = [ ]**

For the outer structure, I will use a list of the recipe dictionaries sorted in numerical order.
